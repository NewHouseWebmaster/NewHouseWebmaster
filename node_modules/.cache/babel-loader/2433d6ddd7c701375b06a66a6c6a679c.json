Believe it or not, it gets hot in Boston. For the first and last few weeks of the academic year (and especially if you're here over the summer), air conditioning becomes invaluable. For the rest of the time, the system is converted over to heating to keep you nice and comfortable. Each room is equipped with a thermostat, so you can adjust the temperature to your liking.</p>\n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className='faq-item'>\n          <div className='faq-q'>\n          Do you have other cool facilities?\n                    </div>\n                    <div className='faq-a'>\n                    <p>WE HAVE SO MANY COOL THINGS.

All MIT dorms, including New House, are very diverse and international-student friendly. New House in particular has a formal system called the Cultural Houses that offer unique living environments in which students live with other students interested in the same culture. We have five of these houses: iHouse (International Development House), Chocolate City, French House, German House, and Spanish House. We also have four numbered houses: House 2, House 3, House 4, and Desmond (House 5), which are are not formally designated as cultural houses, but their communities are equally diverse and welcoming. We recommend checking out the House websites and taking a visit to them all if possible. :) </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className='faq-item'>\n          <div className='faq-q'>\n          What dining options are available?          </div>\n                    <div className='faq-a'>\n                    <p>New House residents have a variety of eating facilities from which to choose. There is an MIT dining hall - Next House Dining - immediately adjacent to New House, and it is open every night for dinner.</p>\n                  <p>Some of our student houses also offer much more affordable meal plan option which are open to both house members and other residents of New House</p>\n                  <p>MIT's student center is open every day and includes Anna's Taqueria, Alpine Bagel and Cambridge Grill, and La Verde's, a general store with a full deli. For more information, see MIT's Campus Dining.</p>\n                  <p>Many of these locations accept TechCash, the debit system attached to your MIT I.D. card. TechCash is accepted on- and off-campus, including Dominos Pizza! (And they deliver.) </p>\n                  <p>New House has extensive fully equipped kitchen facilities, with stoves, microwaves, toasters, and sinks, and residents can store their food and cooking gear in cabinets and public refrigerators. La Verde's in the student center has grocery products, and there is a large grocery store - Trader Joe's - about a 20 minute walk from New House.  </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className='faq-item'>\n          <div className='faq-q'>\n          Are there any videos of New House I can watch?</div>\n                              <div className='faq-a'>\n                              <p>Definitely.

That doesn't necessarily make it far, though. New House is about an 8 minute walk to the Student Center and about 15 minutes to the end of the Infinite Corridor.</p>\n                  <p>The <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/shuttles/tech_shuttle.html\">Tech Shuttle</a> and Campus Saferide Shuttle also stop by New House, and are good alternatives to walking.</p>\n                  <p>Also, many students at MIT in general and New House in particular own bikes. With a bike, it is easy to get from New House to anywhere on campus in less than 10 minutes and to the Student Center in about 3.</p>\n                  <p>Security and facilities, like bike racks, are excellent on campus. There are many stores which sell bikes in Cambridge, ranging from specialty stores like Cambridge Bicycle to Target. </p>\n                  <p> Also, the community here is definitely worth it ;) and you get exercise walking!
