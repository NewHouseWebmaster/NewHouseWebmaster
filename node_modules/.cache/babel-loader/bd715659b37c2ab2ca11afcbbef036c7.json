We have five of these houses: iHouse (International Development House), Chocolate City, French House, German House, and Spanish House. We also have four numbered houses: House 2, House 3, House 4, and Desmond (House 5), which are are not formally designated as cultural houses, but their communities are equally diverse and welcoming.

TechCash is accepted on- and off-campus, including Dominos Pizza! (And they deliver.) </p>\n                  <p>New House has extensive fully equipped kitchen facilities, with stoves, microwaves, toasters, and sinks, and residents can store their food and cooking gear in cabinets and public refrigerators. La Verde's in the student center has grocery products, and there is a large grocery store - Trader Joe's - about a 20 minute walk from New House.  </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className='faq-item'>\n          <div className='faq-q'>\n          Are there any videos of New House I can watch?</div>\n                              <div className='faq-a'>\n                              <p>Definitely.

That doesn't necessarily make it far, though. New House is about an 8 minute walk to the Student Center and about 15 minutes to the end of the Infinite Corridor.</p>\n                  <p>The <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/shuttles/tech_shuttle.html\">Tech Shuttle</a> and Campus Saferide Shuttle also stop by New House, and are good alternatives to walking.</p>\n                  <p>Also, many students at MIT in general and New House in particular own bikes. With a bike, it is easy to get from New House to anywhere on campus in less than 10 minutes and to the Student Center in about 3.</p>\n                  <p>Security and facilities, like bike racks, are excellent on campus. There are many stores which sell bikes in Cambridge, ranging from specialty stores like Cambridge Bicycle to Target. </p>\n                  <p> Also, the community here is definitely worth it ;) and you get exercise walking!
